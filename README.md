# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. It is built using jQuery (including AJAX), HTML5, and CSS3 (with all CSS built from scratch). 

The app supports two different layouts, desktop (when the viewport width is at least 1024px) and mobile.

Note, this app does not incorporate a database so the data does not persist.
